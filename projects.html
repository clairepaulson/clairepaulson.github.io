                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <span>As part of a team that included SMEs in juvenile justice and social work from UNC-Chapel
                            Hill and NC A&T, I designed and developed a 10-module remediation curriculum for juvenile
                            defendants found not competent to stand trial. The curriculum, built as part of a contract
                            between the School of Government and the North Carolina Division of Juvenile Justice, is
                            designed to be used in an intensive 1-on-1 facilitation setting to train these youth about
                            the court process, what it means to be facing charges, and how to navigate the process.
                            Challenges of this project included a tight timeline, unusual delivery setting (online
                            materials delivered in a 1-on-1 face-to-face context), and the need to reach youth of
                            varying ages and abilities with a single product. The final product, due to roll out across
                            North Carolina in 2025, was built in Articulate Rise with multiple Articulate Storyline
                            blocks and Vyond videos, and it is hosted as separate modules within a Canvas course
                            site.</span>

                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <span>In 2024, the School of Government ended its relationship with the company 2U, who had
                            previously managed the school’s online delivery of its Master of Public Administration (MPA)
                            program. I led the migration of the school’s 33 online courses into our learning management
                            system, Canvas. This process was not a simple export-import of course packages, since 2U
                            uses multiple learning tools within Canvas to organize content that we do not use. Using
                            qualitative user research methods and rapid prototyping, my team developed a new
                            comprehensive Canvas course template to use for both online and residential MPA courses to
                            improve usability for students and bolster the school’s desired “one MPA program” branding.
                            We also undertook a thorough QA process, developed and delivered training about the
                            migration to program students, staff, and faculty, and piloted and refined an internal
                            course creation and major course revision process. Despite a tight timeline for the
                            migration and a hiring freeze at the school, we delivered all courses at a higher standard
                            than initially discussed for the initial migration.</span>

                        <span>The Adult Protection Network’s Building Multidisciplinary Teams course is a series of 13
                            modules for professionals in North Carolina communities who may want to launch adult
                            protection multidisciplinary teams – teams that convene to address issues in their community
                            of adult abuse or neglect. APN, an internal organization within the School of Government,
                            contracted with my team to design and develop the course as part of a service agreement with
                            the North Carolina Division of Aging and Adult Services. The course, a traditional
                            interactive slide-based e-learning experience, was developed using the e-learning authoring
                            software DominKnow One and includes talking head videos, custom-built scenarios and
                            interactive activities, and animated videos created with Vyond. I served as the primary
                            instructional designer working on the project, contributing the bulk of the design and
                            development work and also managing work product from a full-time employee, multiple student

                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <span>The Local Elected Leaders Academy is a leadership program for city and county elected
                            officials in North Carolina. To proceed through program “achievement levels,” participants
                            must engage in both leadership courses – many offered by the School of Government – and
                            professional service activities, such as speaking at elected official conferences or serving
                            on committees. Prior to this project, participant progress through the program was tracked
                            on a spreadsheet internal to one of the participating organizations, making it difficult for
                            elected leaders to know how they were progressing. In collaboration with the CPLG, I
                            evaluated several micro-credentialing tools for this unusual use case, selected Canvas
                            Badges (formerly Badgr), and developed a micro-credentialing program within that tool that
                            includes four complex and flexible learning pathways and around 100 badges. I also designed
                            and provided training about the program at professional conferences and co-authored a
                            conference paper about its development.</span>

                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <span>In 2019, in my role as a Program Specialist at the small interdisciplinary Carolina Health
                            Informatics Program (CHIP), I designed, launched, and ran the DataAware summer program for
                            Research Triangle-area high school students. The group of participating students, funded
                            through a federal grant proposal I had written to create the program, came to campus each
                            day for several weeks to study data science with a health care lens, both in a classroom
                            setting and through project work with researchers affiliated with CHIP. While the first year
                            of the program was success, I planned iterations based on student feedback (see poster
                            below). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program was canceled in 2020, and we decided to
                            offer it virtually in 2021. As part of the adaptation to the virtual setting, I collaborated
                            with CHIP colleagues to develop a series of online training modules based on the classroom
                            instruction sequence of the program. These were hosted in Jupyter Notebook, allowing
                            students to complete coding exercises and run code snippets in line with the lesson.</span>
